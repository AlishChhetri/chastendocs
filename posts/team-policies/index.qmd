## Policies for Work Completion on Chasten project

1. Blog posts for the Developer Development website will be created by a committee
of three people. Committees will be assigned for the week on Mondays at 9:35am.

2. The committees will be expected to have final/working drafts by 9:00pm on
Sundays for the post reviewed on Monday, and at 9:00pm on Tuesday for the post
reviewed on Wednesday. Because of this, individual team members are expected to
complete their first professional precis of the week by Wednesdays 9:00am, and
the second by Fridays at 9:00am. 

3. Committees are encouraged to seek help from the team at large if they feel
that they cannot complete their work on time. They are encouraged to do so at
least nine hours prior to their deadline.

4. Failure to meet the goals necessitates that one or more committee members
must write an incident report, to be published as a blog post, and must within
24 hours of that initial deadline have something to show for their work. In 48
hours, it must be complete.

5. Incident reports must consist of a review of the cause of the issue, the issue
itself, and how to resolve/prevent the issue from occuring again.

6. Pull requests to the team's project require three reviewers before they can
be merged. This should be done within a week of a pull request leaving the
'draft' state.

7. We have assigned Policy and Schedule Maintainers, who will be in charge of
updating their corresponding responsibilitiees weekly and/or as needed.

8. At minimum, five issues in the Chasten repository must be worked on per week.
Ideally, ten to twelve will see progress, if not total completion.
