    "text": "🎉 Introduction\n\nChasten is a Python program that uses XPath expressions to find patterns in the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a Python program. You can use Chasten to quickly implement your own configurable linting rules, without having to use a complex AST analysis framework or resorting to imprecise regular expressions.\nDo you want to ensure that a Python program has does not have any triple-nested for loops inside of async functions? Or, do you want to confirm that every function inside your Python program has type annotations and a docstring comment? Chasten can help! It allows you to express these checks — and many other types of analyses as well — in simple YAML files that contain XPath expressions."

Although chasten can generate a starting configuration, you can check out the 📦 AstuteSource/chasten-configuration repository for example(s) of configuration files that setup the tool. Although the config.yml file can reference multiple check configuration files, this example shows how to specify a single checks.yml file:\n# chasten configuration\nchasten:\n  # point to a single checks file\n  checks-file:\n    - checks.yml\nThe checks.yml file must contain one or more checks. What follows is an example of a check configuration file with two checks that respectively find the first executable line of non-test and test-case functions in a Python project. Note that the pattern attribute specifies the XPath version 2.0 expression that chasten will use to detect the specified type of Python function. You can type chasten configure validate --config &lt;path to chasten-configuration/ directory&gt; after filling in &lt;path to chasten-configuration&gt; with the fully-qualified name of your configuration directory and the tool will confirm that your configuration meets the tool’s specification. You can also use the command chasten configure create command to automatically generate a starting configuration! Typing chasten configure --help will explain how to configure the tool.\nchecks:\n  - name: \"all-non-test-function-definition\"\n    code: \"FUNC\"\n    id: \"FUNC001\"\n    description: \"First executable line of a non-test function, skipping over docstrings and/or comments\"\n    pattern: '//FunctionDef[not(contains(@name, \"test_\"))]/body/Expr[value/Constant]/following-sibling::*[1] | //FunctionDef[not(contains(@name, \"test_\"))]/body[not(Expr/value/Constant)]/*[1]'\n  - name: \"all-test-function-definition\"\n    code: \"FUNC\"\n    id: \"FUNC002\"\n    description: \"First executable line of a test function, skipping over docstrings and/or comments\"\n    pattern: '//FunctionDef[starts-with(@name, \"test_\")]/body/Expr[value/Constant]/following-sibling::*[1] | //AsyncFunctionDef[starts-with(@name, \"test_\")]/body/Expr[value/Constant]/following-sibling::*[1] | //FunctionDef[starts-with(@name, \"test_\")]/body[not(Expr/value/Constant)]/*[1] | //AsyncFunctionDef[starts-with(@name, \"test_\")]/body[not(Expr/value/Constant)]/*[1]'\n    count:\n      min: 1\n      max: 10"

    "section": "✨ Analysis",
    "text": "✨ Analysis\nSince chasten needs a project with Python source code as the input to its analysis sub-command, you can clone the 📦 AstuteSource/lazytracker and 📦 AstuteSource/multicounter repositories that are forks of existing Python projects created for convenient analysis. To incrementally analyze these two projects with chasten, you can type the following commands to produce a results JSON file for each project:\n\nAfter creating a subject-data/ directory that contains a lazytracker/ directory, you can run the chasten analyze command for the lazytracker program:\n\nchasten analyze lazytracker \\\n        --config &lt;path to the chasten-configuration/ directory&gt; \\\n        --search-path &lt;path to the lazytracker/ directory&gt; \\\n        --save-directory &lt;path to the subject-data/lazytracker/ directory&gt; \\\n        --save\n\nNow you can scan the output to confirm that, for instance, chasten finds 6 test functions in the lazytracker project. If you look in the subject-data/lazytracker directory you will find a JSON file with a name like chasten-results-lazytracker-20230823162341-4c23fc443a6b4c4aa09886f1ecb96e9f.json. Running chasten on this program more than once will produce a new results file with a different timestamp (i.e., 20230823162341) and unique identifier (i.e., 4c23fc443a6b4c4aa09886f1ecb96e9f) in its name, thus ensuring that you do not accidentally write over your prior results when using --save.\nAfter creating a multicounter/ directory in the existing subject-data/ directory, you can run the chasten analyze command for the multicounter program:\n\nchasten analyze multicounter \\\n        --config &lt;path to the chasten-configuration/ directory&gt; \\\n        --search-path &lt;path to the multicounter/ directory&gt; \\\n        --save-directory &lt;path to the subject-data/lazytracker/ directory&gt; \\\n        --save\n\nNow you can scan the output to confirm that, as an example, chasten finds 10 test functions in the multicounter project. If you look in the subject-data/lazytracker directory you will find a JSON file with a name like chasten-results-multicounter-20230821171712-5c52f2f1b61b4cce97624cc34cb39d4f.json and name components that are similar to the JSON file created for the multicounter program.\nSince the all-test-function-definition check specifies that the program must have between 1 and 10 tests you will notice that this check passes for both lazytracker and multicounter. This means that chasten returns a 0 error code to communicate to your operating system that the check passed.\nYou can learn more about how to use the analyze sub-command by typing chasten analyze --help. For instance, chasten supports the --check-include and --check-exclude options that allow you to respectively include and exclude specific checks according to fuzzy matching rules that you can specify for any of a check’s attributes specified in the checks.yml file."

Now you can use the dashboard in your web browser to analyze the results while you study the source code for these projects with your editor! Examining the results will reveal that chasten, through its use of 📦 spookylukey/pyastgrep, correctly uses the XPath expression for all-test-function-definition to find the first line of executable source code inside of each test, skipping over a function’s docstring and leading comments.\nFor the lazytracker program you will notice that chasten reports that there are 6 test cases even though pytest only finds and runs 5 tests. This is due to the fact that tests/test_tracked.py test suite in lazytracker contains a function starting with test_ inside of another function starting with test_. This example illustrates the limitations of static analysis with chasten! Even though the tool correctly detected all of the “test functions”, the nesting of the functions in the test suite means that pytest will run the outer test_ function and use the inner test_ function for testing purposes.\nWith that said, chasten correctly finds each of the tests for the multicounter project. You can follow each of the previous steps in this document to apply chasten to your own Python program!"

As long as you have followed the installation instructions for 📦 simonw/datasette-publish-fly and 📦 simonw/datasette-publish-vercel, you can use the plugins to deploy a public datasette server that hosts your chasten.db. For instance, running the command chasten datasette-publish &lt;path containing integrated results&gt;/chasten.db --platform vercel will publish the results from running chasten on lazytracker and multicounter to the Vercel platform.\nImportantly, the use of the chasten datasette-publish command with the --platform vercel option requires you to have previously followed the instructions for the datasette-publish-vercel plugin to install the vercel command-line tool. This is necessary because, although datasette-publish-vercel is one of chasten’s dependencies neither chasten nor datasette-publish-vercel provide the vercel tool even though they use it.
